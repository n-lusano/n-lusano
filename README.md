Hello there! My name is Nausicaa:sparkles: :wave: <!-- , and I recently graduated as _Junior Full-stack Developer_. :nerd_face: -->

  <!-- I had no previous experience, but coding has always been a huge interest and a lifelong dream, and I finally took the courage to pursue it. It's never too late to follow your dreams! -->

 <!--  I'm putting everything I learned so far to good use, and I'm very excited to have finally entered the development field as a _professional_ :sparkles::sunglasses: and I'm constantly growing, learning :seedling: and evolving, and I couldn't be happier. :heart: -->

 <!--  Feel free to reach out! :wave: In the meantime, here's a preview of my **[portfolio](https://nlusano.netlify.app/):sparkles:** (WIP :warning:)! -->
